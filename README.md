Partial OCaml interface to the [Zotero Translation Server](https://github.com/zotero/translation-server).

This one uses Lwt so it's compatible with 5.2.0+jst (which doesn't have effects yet).

It also vendors in a chunk of B0 to be standalone.

This isn't really suitable for use by anyone yet except for Anil's personal website.
